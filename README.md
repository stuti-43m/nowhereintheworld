-  What 
 A tribute to unclaimed time zones: Just because nobody uses them doesn’t mean they don’t deserve love.

- Concept 
Time zones are weird. We’ve got GMT, GMT+2, GMT+3—clean, standardized. In an ideal world, we’d have 24 of them.

But why stop at whole numbers? We could have had GMT+1.5, GMT+2.75—heck, even GMT+π. Technically, there are 360 possible time zones (infinite, but let’s not go there). Back in the sundial days, people actually hyper local timezones. Sure some countries decided to be rebels and claimed GMT+5:30, GMT+9:45 etc, leaving us with 48 time zones. But that still means 360 - 48 = 312 unclaimed time zones! 
And I say it's time to honor these forgotten, orphaned time zones—by including them on a clock where, officially, nowhere in the world would it be ticking that time at that moment but in this clock.

- Presentation 
The screen will be housed inside a wooden box, with a small peephole inviting visitors to take a closer look. Peeing inside, they’ll see a screen that randomly selects an unclaimed time zone, displaying the current time at that longitude along with its coordinates. The backdrop will continuously shift through surreal, dreamlike landscapes—imaginary worlds that have now claimed these forgotten time zones.
